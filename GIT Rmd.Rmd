Using GIT as version control is saving me a lot of different file versions on my PC. However the first time I had to go back and undo changes, it was a nervous wrack. I had put myself in "detached HEAD mode" and I was a bit scared the whole thing would fall apart. So I have one piece of advice... if it's your first time going back into previous commits, don't immediately do it on a file that matters, but create a new repository to try things out where it doesn't really matter. 
  
In fact, it might not be bad to play around with GIT on such a repository just to get the hang of it. I did that quite a bit and I feel an aweful lot more secure with GIT undoing since I did that.
