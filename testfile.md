some bogus info
making some changes upon request


new change is not in here

Four months ago on Nov 3rd, I made a Github account. But I would only start to actually start using it as of Nov 26th. Since day however I have made daily use of GitHub and later as well of GitLab, the equivalent we use at work. It's


+ Personally I found the GIT Rstudio integration quite a pain. It did not always do what I wanted it to do, and I did not find it that intuitive. So i bit the bullet and started to exclusively use the command line - which was a brilliant decision.

+ I made a bogus repo on Github that did not contain any valuable code but only served as a GIT learning repo. Before I would actually do something possibly dangerous on a real repo, I would simulate it on the GIT repo, which gave me tremendous piece of mind. It also allowed me to experiment at will. If you want to test collaborative GIT, you can even make two clones of the same repo locally, so you can test what happens with merge conflicts etc.

+ The biggest pain so far was the installation on my work pc where I wanted to connect to both GitHub Ã nd Gitlab. Jenny Bryan came to the rescue via handing me this brilliant tutorial.

+ I'm now a complete GIT convert. I use it for everything. I love the open source element. And I've already been spreading the GIT virus tos ome colleagues - although not all of them are as enthusiastic :)

To celebrate my 4 months membership of GIT I also wanted to share my ongoing notes of the things I had to figure out along the way:


* Detached HEAD started

* Changing my mind and renaming my repo
